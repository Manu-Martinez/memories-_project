# memories-_project

# This is a project made using MongoDB, Express, React and Node to build a simple MERN fullstack social media app.
# In Memories, users can post pictures with tags, as well as update and delete the posts, like and comment other people's memories.
# For now, users can login only by signing up with their emails, but Google Auth will be added in the future.
